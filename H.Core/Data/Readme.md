### Repository Pattern: 
The Repository pattern provides an abstraction layer between the business logic and the data storage, allowing you to encapsulate the data access operations for each entity. It provides a consistent interface for querying and modifying data, promoting separation of concerns and testability.

```query = includeProperties.Aggregate(query, (current, includeProperty) => current.Include(includeProperty));```

### Unit of Work Pattern: 
The Unit of Work pattern helps manage transactions and ensures that multiple database operations are treated as a single atomic unit. It allows you to track changes across multiple repositories and persist them in a coordinated manner, promoting consistency and data integrity.

### ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) Framework: 
Using an ORM framework like Entity Framework (EF) or NHibernate can simplify the mapping between your object-oriented model and the relational database. ORM frameworks automate the CRUD operations, handle database connections, and provide features like change tracking and caching.

### Dependency Injection (DI) Pattern: 
Applying the DI pattern helps manage the dependencies between different components of your data access layer. It enables loose coupling, promotes modular design, and facilitates testing and maintenance. DI containers like Autofac, Unity, or ASP.NET Core's built-in DI container can be used to handle dependency injection.

### Query Builder or Specification Pattern: 
A Query Builder or Specification pattern can be used to build complex database queries dynamically. These patterns provide a fluent interface or reusable query specification classes to construct queries with various filtering, sorting, and paging criteria, enabling more flexible and maintainable querying capabilities.

### Caching Pattern: 
Introducing a caching layer can significantly improve the performance of your data access layer. By caching frequently accessed data, you reduce the need for expensive database queries. Caching frameworks like Redis or in-memory caches can be used to store and retrieve cached data efficiently.
